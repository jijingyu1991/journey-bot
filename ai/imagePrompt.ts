const imagePrompt = `## Design Style
- Hand-drawn timeline-based itinerary with integrated time and location information
- Concise and clear content with appropriate spacing
- Soft color scheme, avoiding overly vibrant colors

## Integrated Timeline
- Create a single cohesive timeline that displays both time and location together
- Each timeline point should clearly show both time and corresponding location
- Use visual hierarchy to distinguish between time and location at each point
- Display relative positions of attractions when latitude and longitude information is available
- For multiple locations, include a small map representation alongside the timeline

## Text Style
- Use clear, legible fonts supported by DALLÂ·E 3 such as Arial, Helvetica, or Times New Roman
- Time information in bold and slightly larger
- Location names with medium emphasis
- Details in smaller font size
